    <h1 class='centered'>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

    <p class='centered resize'>From western Philadelphia I hail
    where in my youth<br> I'd play upon the green
    'til - rue the day! <br>I found myself assail'd
    by ruffians contemptible and mean.<br>
    Although the spat was trivial and brief,
    it wounded my dear mother deep within;<br>
    and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
    she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.<br>
    When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
    I came upon a coachman most unique;<br>
    and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
    despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.<br>
    I survey all the land with princely mien
    in fair <span class='jump'>Bel-Air</span>, where I do lay my scene.</p>
